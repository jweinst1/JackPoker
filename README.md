# Royal

*A modern, state of the art, Poker modeling engine*


## Prerequisites

In order to build `royal`, you will need additional components aside from a C++ compiler.

**On Unix (Linux, OS X)**

* A compiler with C++11 support
* CMake >= 2.8.12

**On Windows**

* Visual Studio 2015 (required for all Python versions, see notes below)
* CMake >= 3.1



## Special notes for Windows

**Compiler requirements**

Pybind11 requires a C++11 compliant compiler, i.e Visual Studio 2015 on Windows.
This applies to all Python versions, including 2.7. Unlike regular C extension
modules, it's perfectly fine to compile a pybind11 module with a VS version newer
than the target Python's VS version. See the [FAQ] for more details.

**Runtime requirements**

The Visual C++ 2015 redistributable packages are a runtime requirement for this
project. It can be found [here][vs2015_runtime]. If you use the Anaconda Python
distribution, you can add `vs2015_runtime` as a platform-dependent runtime
requirement for you package: see the `conda.recipe/meta.yaml` file in this example.


## Building the documentation

Documentation for the example project is generated using Sphinx. Sphinx has the
ability to automatically inspect the signatures and documentation strings in
the extension module to generate beautiful documentation in a variety formats.
The following command generates HTML-based reference documentation; for other
formats please refer to the Sphinx manual:

 - `cd cmake_example/docs`
 - `make html`


## Test call

```python
import cmake_example
cmake_example.add(1, 2)
```
